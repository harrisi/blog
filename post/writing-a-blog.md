# Writing a blog

~~I'm going to write a blog.~~ I'm writing a blog. I have a few months to sort of figure out my whole life, so I figure I should start by completely changing everything that I do.


## Plan

The general idea is that I want to prove to myself that I can be productive and make things I'm proud of. For the last few years I've sort of given up on myself, and I need to change that. I know I'm capable of more than what I've been doing, and I'm going to show it.

My goal is to make a few things over the next few months. So far I'm not sure what I'm going to make, how long each thing will take, what being "done" means, or anything, really. I think the first thing to do is to do something, which this is. There's not a lot to say about putting text on the internet though, and it's not much of a project, but my self-doubt is so strong that even doing this feels impossible. I think some of this will be more long form and some will essentially just be tweets. I should probably just get on social media again, but that's not making something (although, it is _doing_ something..).

## Goals

I want an easy way to make this work for me. Mastodon, RSS, Twitter, Facebook, etc. all do that already, but I'm not doing this for social clout - I'm doing it for me. So that means I need a few things:

### Easy content management

I use a few different devices, including my Lenovo Chromebook, MacBook Air M2, Mid(?)-2017 MacBook Pro, iPhone 12 Mini, various work desktops (well, not anymore), siblings/friends computer(s), misc. computers at Best Buy, Apple, etc., and probably some more.

I'd like to be able to at least add content from any of them. I think the easiest way to do this would be to have `/post` be public or have a very simple password that just takes in text and adds it to a queue of posts, that I would manually accept when I'm on a trusted device.

For updating/deleting on the go, this would need more authentication, so it leads to the question of why not just have that authentication anyway?

### Easy software management

This is something I should probably just leave to the professionals. I know there are tons of options for dealing with hosting and writing a blog however I'd want. I could use Svelte, Vue, React, Medium, Substack, Bear, Github Pages, ... but the whole point of the next few months is to make things. I think hosting this on my own (virtual) server, writing my own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and having a place to call my own would be good. For my other projects, I already know I'll want to write them in vanilla everything, but I think I'll need to treat them more like products and use all the tools available to me that make sense. I'm a real sucker for hand-written code with little-to-no dependencies, but I want to crank out ideas as efficiently as possible for the rest of the year. This can be my little happy place to carve and whittle my little chunks of wood into slightly different looking chunks of wood to put on my window sill.

### Possible syndication?

I should probably dive back into social media, but I really don't know anyone anymore.

!!! END !!!

So this could be a section where after !!! END !!! I can put whatever notes and whatnot, and it wouldn't be read. I want a good way to keep notes about whatever I'm writing, I guess. I also would want to have some inline, though. (As an aside, what is a good way to add an aside to markdown?)

Anyway, I should write something about UI and aesthetics. 

Also, can I `hunspell` from in vim?
