I think this should maybe be restructured as a look at html fragments and templating options.

# HTML Templates

what do I even want to talk about

how html templates work, and my problem with them

Look at Liquid

it introduces a build step, but produces a single file

What do I want even

a way to write html(/markdown, but using markdown introduces a build step anyway) using templates that generates a single file with no build step

How would it work

I'm not sure. the server would have to be doing something.

Can I achieve it today?

sort of, using iframes. it causes multiple requests though, or including the fragments inline with srcdoc.

use <noscript>?
